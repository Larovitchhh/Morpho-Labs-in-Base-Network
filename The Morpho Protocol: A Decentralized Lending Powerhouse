At the core of Morpho Labsâ€™ offerings is the Morpho Protocol, a permissionless, non-custodial lending platform designed to optimize lending and borrowing for users while providing developers with a flexible infrastructure for building custom DeFi applications. The protocol operates as an on-chain peer-to-peer (P2P) layer built on top of existing lending pools like Aave and Compound, enhancing capital efficiency while maintaining liquidity and security guarantees.
